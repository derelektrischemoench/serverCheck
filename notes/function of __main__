- if a file gets executed via python filename.py it gets assigned the
name "main"

- so if you put a "if __name__ == "main" "" into the code it runs only
if the file is executed directly and not if it was imported

- __main__ is the code execution entry point, that gets triggered, only
if the function is called explicitly and not from somewhere else

With this behavior any py file can exhibit dual behavior - it is a script as well as module. As a programmer, you can
conditionally execute code based on whether it is being run as a script or is being imported as a module.

A very common use of this is to put test code of your script inside the if condition that you mentioned, while allowing
others to use it as a module and not impacting their usage of the module.
